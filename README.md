This is an exploratory data analysis of craft beers and breweries in the United States, all 50 states plus Washington,DC. The study has three main objectives, to evaluate the number of craft breweries in each state, to provide summary statistics of craft beer metrics, and to investigate statistical relationships between these metrics. We aim to provide useful insight into the craft beer industry of value to executives of Budweiser.
